  False Positives:
  * EKS Cluster being created or deleted may be performed by a system administrator.
  * Verify whether the user identity, user agent, and/or hostname should be making changes in your environment.
  * EKS Cluster created or deleted from unfamiliar users should be investigated. If known behavior is causing false positives, it can be exempted from the rule.
